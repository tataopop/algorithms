### Leetcode 375. Guess Number Higher or Lower II

We are playing the Guessing Game. The game will work as follows:

I pick a number between 1 and n.
You guess a number.
If you guess the right number, you win the game.
If you guess the wrong number, then I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower, and you will continue guessing.
Every time you guess a wrong number x, you will pay x dollars. If you run out of money, you lose the game.
Given a particular n, return the minimum amount of money you need to guarantee a win regardless of what number I pick.

#### Example :
```
Input: n = 10
Output: 16
Explanation: The winning strategy is as follows:
- The range is [1,10]. Guess 7.
    - If this is my number, your total is $0. Otherwise, you pay $7.
    - If my number is higher, the range is [8,10]. Guess 9.
        - If this is my number, your total is $7. Otherwise, you pay $9.
        - If my number is higher, it must be 10. Guess 10. Your total is $7 + $9 = $16.
        - If my number is lower, it must be 8. Guess 8. Your total is $7 + $9 = $16.
    - If my number is lower, the range is [1,6]. Guess 3.
        - If this is my number, your total is $7. Otherwise, you pay $3.
        - If my number is higher, the range is [4,6]. Guess 5.
            - If this is my number, your total is $7 + $3 = $10. Otherwise, you pay $5.
            - If my number is higher, it must be 6. Guess 6. Your total is $7 + $3 + $5 = $15.
            - If my number is lower, it must be 4. Guess 4. Your total is $7 + $3 + $5 = $15.
        - If my number is lower, the range is [1,2]. Guess 1.
            - If this is my number, your total is $7 + $3 = $10. Otherwise, you pay $1.
            - If my number is higher, it must be 2. Guess 2. Your total is $7 + $3 + $1 = $11.
The worst case in all these scenarios is that you pay $16. Hence, you only need $16 to guarantee a win.
```

#### Solution :
```
class Solution {
    public int getMoneyAmount(int n) {
        int[][] dp = new int[n + 1][n + 1];
        for(int k = 1; k < n + 1; k++) {
            for(int i = 1; i + k < n + 1; i++) {
                if(k == 1) {
                    dp[i][i + k] = i;
                } else {
                    dp[i][i + k] = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
                    for(int j = i + 1; j < i + k; j++) {
                        int localMax = j + Math.max(dp[i][j - 1], dp[j + 1][i + k]);
                        dp[i][i + k] = Math.min(dp[i][i + k], localMax);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[1][n];
    }
}
```
